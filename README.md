# Abstract:
The data from Stack Overflow is useful in analyzing the latest trends, most-used technologies, and problems faced by developers. This project analyzes the Stack Overflow data dump using Big Data Frameworks like Apache Spark, AWS Glue, and Amazon Redshift. Our aim is to derive valuable insights into the latest trends in programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.

# Project Goals and Objectives:
Analyze Stack Overflow data using Big Data frameworks like Apache Spark and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Understand user patterns and behaviors on the Stack Overflow platform.
Identify the most preferred programming languages, frameworks, and technology trends.
Develop interactive visualizations using Tableau.

# Problem Statement and Motivation:
Stack Overflow has a huge inflow of daily data, making it challenging to derive meaningful insights. Our analysis aims to:

Investigate user behavior and interaction patterns on the Stack Overflow platform.
Identify challenges and trends in the programming industry.

# Project Deliverables:
A comprehensive report of the project's architecture, methodology, and results.
Code and scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
A Tableau dashboard with graphical representations of the analysis findings.
An interactive Tableau Public link.

# Project Background:
Used Technologies
AWS EC2: Scalable compute capacity for running Apache Spark and other tools.
AWS S3: Cloud-based storage solution for scalable data storage.
AWS EMR: Web service that manages Hadoop clusters and big data frameworks like Spark.
AWS Glue: Fully managed ETL service for data transformation.
AWS Redshift: Fully managed data warehouse service.
Amazon Athena: For queries.
Apache Spark: Open-source distributed computing framework.
PySpark: Python API for Apache Spark.
Tableau: Visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards.

# Dataset Details:
Dataset Source: Stack Exchange Archive (hosted on archive.org)
Format: Compressed XML (7z format)
Size: Approximately 98GB
Fields:
ID, Creation Date, Title, Body, Comments, Accepted Answer ID, Answers, Favorite Count, Owner Display Name, User ID, Parent ID, Post Type, Score, Tags, Views.

# System Design:
System Architecture:

# System Components
Data Extraction
Extract data from Stack Exchange Archive.
Store decompressed data into an AWS S3 bucket.
Data Preprocessing and Transformation:
Convert data from XML to Parquet format using PySpark.
Clean and transform data using AWS Glue.

# Data Storage:
Store processed data in AWS Redshift for further analysis.

# Design Challenges
Interface Design: Ensuring a user-friendly interface for effective data exploration.
Security: Restricting data access to authorized individuals.
Scalability: Designing a data management system that can handle large volumes of data.

# System Implementation

# Summary:
Goal: Analyze user questions and identify trends and patterns in user searches on Stack Overflow.
Tools: Apache Spark, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, Tableau.
Implementation Steps
Setting up the EC2 Instance:
Create an EC2 instance with Ubuntu and install necessary Python and 7z packages.
Extract data from the Stack Exchange Archive and store it in an S3 bucket.
Creating the EMR Cluster:
Create an EMR cluster with JupyterHub, Apache Spark, and HBase.
Process and transform data using PySpark.
ETL Automation with AWS Glue:
Create an AWS Glue job to automate the ETL process.
Analysis in Redshift:
Create a Redshift database schema with relevant tables.
Execute SQL queries for insights in Tableau.
Results from Athena queries are output as csv file and metadata. This is uploaded to the git.

# Visualization in Tableau:
Connect Tableau to Redshift for data visualization.
Create dashboards for trend analysis.
